## Code release plan
- [x] Inference code for novel view synthesis
- [x] GAS checkpoints release on Hugging Face 
- [ ] Inference code for novel pose synthesis
- [ ] Inference code for synchronized multi-view video generation

## Requirements
* An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required. 
  * We have tested on a single A4500 and A100 GPU.
  * The minimum GPU memory required for inference is 20GB.
* Operating system: Linux
## Installation
Instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).


## Inference
Create a folder `demo_images` inside the project directory and move your testing image into it, e.g., GAS/demo_images/image.png. 
### Novel view synthesis
```
bash demo_scripts/nv.sh
```

### Novel pose synthesis
TBD

### Multi-view video generation
TBD
